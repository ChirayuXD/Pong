# Pong
Pong game made using Lua and Love2d
This is my first project in love and lua2d to make the pong game. I made such that the game is as close as possible to the original game and have given it a retro look for better aesthetics.
Hope  you enjoy the game
TO RUN THE GAME-
download the pong game.zip file and extract the contents. Then run the .exe file in the folder and enjoy
